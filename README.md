# Hi, I'm Aayush Bothra! 👋
Aspiring Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Machine Learning Enthusiast
Building solutions that make a difference, one line of code at a time.

## 🚀 About Me
I’m Aayush, a Computer Science grad student at the University of Southern California. My journey into tech started with curiosity, but it quickly turned into a passion for solving real-world problems using code. From creating responsive web applications to diving into the intricacies of machine learning, I love taking on new challenges that push me to grow as a developer.

When I’m not coding, you can find me reading up on the latest tech trends, exploring cloud infrastructure, or contributing to open-source projects.

## 💼 Experience Snapshot
****Software Engineering Intern @ River Route Creative Group LLP****
Jan 2024 - June 2024
At River Route, I had the opportunity to engineer a full-stack web platform that helps cancer patients. Using the power of MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I created a platform that is not only user-friendly but also secure and scalable. I’m proud of the 35% reduction in latency and the increase in visitor engagement, all while learning how impactful software can be in real life.

## 🛠️ Tech Toolbox
I believe the right tools make all the difference. Here’s my personal toolbox:

**Languages**: C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, NoSQL
**Frameworks & Libraries**: React.js, Flask, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (Mongoose)
**Cloud Services**: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure
**Dev Tools**: Git, GitHub, JIRA, Trello, Agile Methodologies
Whether it’s building the backend, crafting a seamless user interface, or automating cloud deployments, I’m always learning and expanding my skillset.

## 🌱 What I'm Working On
Here’s a sneak peek into some of the exciting projects I’ve been working on:

**🎨 ColorizeAI** – Coloring the world, one pixel at a time
Using GAN and CNN architectures, I created an AI-powered model that brings black-and-white images to life by colorizing them automatically. It’s like giving history a fresh coat of paint! I trained the model on over 50,000 images and reduced the loss from 0.7 to 0.03 in 50 epochs. It’s been an incredible journey of pushing the boundaries of AI.

**🌾 AgriConnect** – Empowering farmers through technology
This e-commerce platform bridges the gap between local farmers and consumers. AgriConnect eliminates middlemen, helping 50+ farmers reach 300+ consumers directly. I developed features like real-time catalog updates, secure payment processing via Stripe, and location-based filtering to support local economies.

**🗣️ PolySpeech** – Breaking language barriers, one word at a time
Imagine a world where 72 languages can be transcribed instantly. That’s what I aimed for with GlobalVoices. Using DeepSpeech and JavaScript, I built a speech-to-text app with a 68% accuracy rate. It’s my take on enhancing global communication through technology.

**📦 InventoryPro** – Intelligent inventory management
I created a role-based website that makes inventory management smarter, faster, and more secure. With three user roles (Admin, Special, User) and encrypted access, StockSmart has reduced unauthorized access incidents by 40%. Plus, its sleek dashboard ensures businesses can track top-selling products and manage stock like pros.
